# Model Context Protocol Specification

## Protocol Overview

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a framework designed to standardize the interaction between AI models and external data sources. It provides a unified architecture for real-time data integration, context management, and decision-making processes. MCP ensures seamless communication between clients and servers, enabling scalable and efficient AI-driven applications.

## Core Components

1. **Client**: Handles user input, communicates with the server, and displays results.
2. **Server**: Processes client requests, integrates with external APIs, and executes tools.
3. **Tools**: Modular components that perform specific tasks, such as data fetching or analysis.
4. **Communication Protocol**: Defines the data exchange format between clients and servers.

## Interfaces

- **Client-Server Communication**: JSON-based request and response payloads over HTTP or Stdio.
- **Tool Interface**: Tools are defined with input/output schemas and invoked by the server.
- **External API Integration**: Interfaces with APIs like MASA for data retrieval and processing.

## Data Flow

1. User input is collected by the client and sent to the server.
2. The server identifies and invokes the appropriate tools.
3. Tools fetch or process data and return results to the server.
4. The server aggregates results and sends them back to the client.
5. The client displays the results to the user.

## Context Management

- **Dynamic Context Handling**: Updates context in real-time based on user input and tool outputs.
- **State Management**: Maintains session state and contextual data for multi-step workflows.

## Integration Guidelines

1. Install dependencies and configure environment variables.
2. Define new tools with input/output schemas and integrate with APIs or models.
3. Extend the client interface to support additional features.
4. Test new tools and features using unit and integration tests.
5. Deploy the server on a scalable platform and ensure client compatibility.
